            <h2>Encryption</h2><br>
            <p>Encryption is the process of converting data into a form that cannot be read by unauthorized individuals. This is done by using a mathematical algorithm to scramble the data, and then a key to unscramble it. The key is a secret that only the authorized individuals know.</p>
            <p>There are two main types of encryption: symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption.</p>
            <ul><br>
                <li><strong>Symmetric key encryption:</strong> Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. It is faster but requires both sender and recipient to know the key.</li>
                <li><strong>Asymmetric key encryption:</strong> Uses two different keys for encryption and decryption. It is more secure but slower.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>How Encryption Works</h3>
            <p>Encryption involves two main components: a plaintext (original data) and a secret key. The encryption algorithm uses the key to transform the plaintext into ciphertext, which is a scrambled version of the data. Only someone with the corresponding decryption key can reverse this process and obtain the original data.</p>
            <br><h3>Use Cases of Encryption</h3>
            <ul><br>
                <li>Secure communication over the internet (HTTPS)</li>
                <li>Data protection in storage (e.g., encrypting files)</li>
                <li>Securing sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers</li>
            </ul><br>

        <section id="hashing-section" class="card">
            <h2>Hashing</h2><br>
            <p>Hashing is a different type of security mechanism that is used to verify the authenticity of data. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input of any size and produces an output of a fixed size. This output is called a hash value or digest.</p>
            <p>The hash value of a piece of data is unique to that data. If even a single bit of the data is changed, the hash value will be completely different. This makes hash functions useful for verifying the integrity of data.</p>
            <br><h3>How Hashing Works</h3>
            <p>Hashing takes input data and applies a hashing algorithm to generate a unique fixed-length string of characters, known as a hash or hash code. The key characteristic of hashing is that it's a one-way process, meaning you cannot reverse the hash to obtain the original data.</p>
            <h3>Use Cases of Hashing</h3>
            <ul><br>
                <li>Storing passwords securely: Hash passwords before storing them in databases</li>
                <li>Data integrity verification: Check if data has been tampered with</li>
                <li>Digital signatures</li>

            <h2>Differences between Encryption and Hashing</h2>
            <ul><br>
                <li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> Encryption is reversible, while hashing is irreversible.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Encryption is used to protect the confidentiality of data, while hashing is used to verify the authenticity of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Encryption is typically used for data in transit, while hashing is typically used for data at rest.</li>

            <h2>Applications of Encryption and Hashing</h2>
            <h3>Encryption</h3>
            <ul><br>
                <li>Encryption is a two-way process. The data is encrypted using a key, and then it can be decrypted using the same key.</li>
                <li>The key can be either symmetric or asymmetric. A symmetric key is the same for both encryption and decryption. An asymmetric key has two different keys, one for encryption and one for decryption.</li>
                <li>Encryption is used to protect the confidentiality of data. This means that only the intended recipient can read the data.</li>
                <li>Encryption is typically used for data in transit, such as when data is being sent over a network.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>Hashing</h3>
            <ul><br>
                <li>Hashing is a one-way process. The data is hashed using a hash function, and then the hash value cannot be reversed to the original data.</li>
                <li>The hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input of any size and produces an output of a fixed size.</li>
                <li>The hash value of a piece of data is unique to that data. If even a single bit of the data is changed, the hash value will be completely different.</li>
                <li>Hashing is used to verify the authenticity of data. This means that the data has not been tampered with since it was created.</li>
                <li>Hashing is typically used for data at rest, such as data stored on a hard drive.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <ul><br>
                <li>Encryption is more computationally expensive than hashing.</li>
                <li>Hashing is not as secure as encryption.</li>
                <li>Encryption can be used to protect both the confidentiality and integrity of data, while hashing can only be used to protect the integrity of data.</li>
                <li>Encryption and hashing can be used together to provide even more security.</li>
